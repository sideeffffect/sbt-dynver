### Breaking Changes

#### tweak `version` to make it compatible with ivy2/maven wildcard patterns

Prior to this change, the first "dirty" version (i.e with local, uncommitted changes) after a tag had the form
`1.0.0+20140707-1030` (tag version + timestamp), while the version on the first commit after a tag was
`1.0.0+1-1234abcd` (tag version + commit distance + commit sha). This meant that a version specified like
"1.0.0+" would select the older version over the newer one.

From version 3.0.0 onwards the first dirty version contains "+0" and the commit sha:
`1.0.0+0-1234abcd-20140707-1030`.

Thank you [@leonardehrenfried][]! But also [@lokkju][] reporting the issue, and [@raboof][] and [@laughedelic][]
for helping in the review.

### Improvements

- Introduces `dynverSonatypeSnapshots` (disabled by default) which appends "-SNAPSHOT" to the version if
    `isSnapshot` is `true` (it's only false when on a tag with no local changes). This opt-in makes it easier to
    use sbt-dynver when publishing to Sonatype snapshots. [#53][]/[#64][] by [@leonardehrenfried][]

Thanks again [@leonardehrenfried][].
